# CASE STUDY 
(Part 1)-----
    As a marketing VP of an ecommerce gaint, the client would like to identify all the Young and 
    Senior citizen customers who spent less than $6 on an average per transaction starting from year 2010 till date
    The purpose is to reach out to these customers through email campaign
    so that those customers utilize those campaigns to buy more

(Part 2) ----
    Make a report that can help the VP slice and dice data to understand the picture across 
    various countries for different time periods and demographics


Approach (how do we go about solving this)

1. Understand the business problem well

2. What kind of data would be required - 
   -Order detail (may not necessraily have the product detail)..
 which customer contributed to what spends on what dates
   - Cust detail - demographics (age), email?

3. Data Understanding
   - Rows and col (var)
   - Eyeball the data (look at the top and bottom records)
   - What each of the var mean (data dictionary doc)
      (VAR  |  DESC   |   DATA TYPE)
   - Level or granularity of the data
   - Data types (categorial, date, cont, string)
   - Data Quality checks (missing values, error, outliers, duplicates)
   - Unique values, # of unique cat
   - Stats - Min, Max, Median, Mean, SD

4. Data Manipulations
   - Rows - add rows, del row
   - Col - add, del , rename
   - Filtering (scoping the analysis)
   - Changing the values of the records based on a condition (replacing values)
     - Missing value treatment
     - Outlier treatment
     - String/ number manipulations
Low <-> low
   - Change the data types (correct)
   - Sorting
   - Grouping/ Aggregation/ Roll Up
